# Challenge-2
Challenge 2 for Columbia FinTech Bootcamp


## Description
This program prompts a user for the following inputs:
* The location of a bank data csv (file path) that specifies: 
    * The name of the bank
    * The maximum loan amount from that bank
    * The maximum LTV (loan-to-value ratio) they will allow
    * The maximum DTI (debt-to-income ratio) they will allow
    * The minimum credit score to take out a loan
    * The interest rate attached to their loans
* The user's credit score (integer)
* The user's current monthly debt (float)
* The user's monthly income (float)
* The user's desired loan amount (float)
* The user's home value (float)

The program then finds the loans in the provided dataset that match the user's inputted credit profile. The user is then prompted to save these qualifying loans in a new csv file.
